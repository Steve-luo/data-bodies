  <h4>About</h4>
  <div class="container">
  <p> In the digital era, we are getting used to moving our bodies in digital space. While we are mentally connected to digital space
    and shifting from one site to another bodilessly, our physical bodies are anchored in one place and the only movement we do is using a mouse, typing, and watching the screen.

Data Bodies is a Firefox extension created as an artware project in the Net Art && Culture class at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. It tracks users’ body movements online. The extension records the mouse movement, the click position, and scroll amount while using the web browser, and visualize them as an abstract digital painting. The history of users’ mouse movements represents their interests, concentration, and distraction as a consequence of user interfaces and user experience design of websites.

Users can save their history on the popup window, and upload it to the Data Bodies gallery website to share it with other users. The results of Data Bodies in the gallery show the amount of time staying online and may be able to display certain patterns of the mouse movements among people. Data Bodies artware extension can reveal the invisible bodiless movement of Internet users as an artwork.
